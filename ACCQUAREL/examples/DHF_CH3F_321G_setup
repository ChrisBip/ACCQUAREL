## BASIS DEFINITION
* The first entry is the keyword 'BASIS' followed by the name of the basis set contained in the basis/ directory or the keywords 'EVEN-TEMPERED BASIS'.
* The second entry is the choice of CONTRACTED or UNCONTRACTED basis functions for the calculation or the number of exponents for the even-tempered basis set. In the last case, the first term and the common ratio of the geometric series must be given, in this order, as two separate entries.
* The next two entries are are for the relativistic case: application or not of the Kinetic Balance scheme (KINBAL/NOTKINBAL) and, if so, choice between the RESTRICTED or UNRESTRICTED scheme.

## SCF PARAMETERS OF THE COMPUTATION
* They are:
* - the number of different scf algorithms to be used on the considered case,
* - the "numbers" of the algorithms (1 is for Roothaan, 2 is for level-shifting, 3 is for DIIS, 4 is for ODA, 5 is for ES's),
* - the threshold for numerical convergence,
* - the maximum number of iterations allowed,
* - two indicators to know if the bielectronic integrals are directly computed and, if not, if their list and values are stored on disk or not,
* - an indicator to make the computation without using the SS-bielectronic integrals in the relativistic case.
